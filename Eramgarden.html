<h2>Eram garden</h2>

<p>Both the building and the garden were built during the middle of thirteenth century by the Ilkhanate or a paramount chief of the Qashqai
  tribes of Pars. The original layout of the garden however, with its quadripartite Persian paradise garden structure was most likely laid in 
  eleventh century by the Seljuqs, and was then referred to as Bāgh-e Shāh ("The emperor's garden" in Persian) and was much less complicated or
  ornamental.[1] Cornelius de Bruyn, a traveller from the Netherlands, wrote a description of the gardens in the eighteenth century.</p>
